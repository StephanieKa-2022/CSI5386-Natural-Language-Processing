# CSI5386-Natural-Language-Processing | Assignment 1 | Part 2
Sentence Embedding Projects 
- Doc2Vec
- Sentence-BERT
- Universal Sentence Encoder 


In this project, our goal is to calculate the cosine similarity between two sentence extracted from a text file.

You can find the two Python files for the embedding and similarity analysis:
- CSI 5386 - NPL Assignment 1 - Part 2 | Doc2Vec.ipynb
- CSI 5386 - NPL Assignment 1 - Part 2 | S-Bert & USE.ipynb


Make sure to have the text file uplaoded in the colab file section before running the programs.
The results of each program are delivered in a data frame format, and they can be saved in CSV file.
